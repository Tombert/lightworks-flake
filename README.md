# Lightworks Flake

As of the time of this, Lightworks in nixpkgs is broken.  I have a PR but I'm impatient and wanted to get this working with the latest lightworks, so I hacked up the Lightworks [package.nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/ed331ebdcc2d472e5f7bf14b0c84d100e069f1bc/pkgs/by-name/li/lightworks/package.nix#L20) and converted it into a Flake so I can easily run it. Just to be clear, my work here is a hack job, the hard work was done by the original project maintainers, not me. 

There's no reason for me not to share this.  Here you go!
